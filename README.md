This free tool is built based on [FIRE](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/) (Financial Independence / Retirement Early) concept. The gist of it is you want to save enough money so you can just live on 4.5% (based on [Trinity study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_study)) yearly withdrawl rate from your investment capital gain. For example, if you want to retire when you turn 40, and you normally spend $100k yearly, then you need at least $2.2M networth.

Simple Math:
4.5% * $2.2M = $100k

So where does this tool fit in or how does it help? From the forum, people are still using Mint or keep track of their finance manually in Excel, while there's nothing wrong with that but this tool with FIRE focus will help you get there faster!
