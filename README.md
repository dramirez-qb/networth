## What is FIRE?

This free tool is built based on [FIRE](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/) (Financial Independence / Retirement Early) concept. The gist of it is you want to save enough money so you can just live on 4.5% (based on [Trinity study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_study)) yearly withdrawl rate from your investment capital gain. For example, if you want to retire when you turn 40, and you normally spend $100k yearly, then you need at least $2.2M networth.

Simple Math:
4.5% * $2.2M = $100k
